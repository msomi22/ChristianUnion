  Load Test: We subject the application to work level approaching the limit of its spesifications.

             GOAL: Define the maximum amount of work the system can handle without significance 
                   performance degradation.


  
       1)Longevity/Endurance testing: - we evaluates system's ability to handle constant moderate work load for a long time.

       2)Volume Testing: - we subject the system to heavy work load for a limited time
       
       NB:
       Stress Testing:
       we evaluate the extents to which the system keep working when subjected to extreme work loads


 Pilot Test: group of end users will try the system prior to it full deployment, this will enable us give back feedback on the performance of the system

 Beta Test: testing the product in it user's environment (by all users)
